![Next Core](/img/core_next.jpg)

Next Core was designed from the ground up to give you the best experience as a
flight director. It includes several persistent components with a dynamic
section in the middle for whatever you might need at any given moment. It is the
recommended core for main use by any Thorium Flight Director.

In the top left corner is the [sensors grid core](/docs/card_sensors.html).
Below that is the extras core, with the actions, timer, dice, and alert
condition. The core feed is below that. Each of the core feed sections can be
expanded, giving the flight director direct access to respond to incoming
notifications.

On the far right is the timeline core, always available for moving the mission
forward.

In the center is a standard [dynamic core](/docs/core_dynamic.html).
