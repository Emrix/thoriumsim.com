Dynamic Core can be used to arrange the cores in any array you would like. This is helpful in making a core that works just right for your simulator. 

The core can be configured by clicking the yellow "Edit" button in the upper left hand corner. Dynamic core allows you to scale and resize any of the core widgets.



Below is an example of the Dynamic core!
