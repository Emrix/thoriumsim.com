The viewscreen core allows the flight director to control what is displaying on
the viewscreen. It is split into four sections:

* **Top left** Viewscreen Display - This shows what is currently displayed on
  the viewscreen
* **Top right** Viewscreen Picker - This lets you configure and control the
  viewscreen
* **Bottom left** Viewscreen Preview - Preview and queue what will show on the
  viewscreen next
* **Bottom right** Individual screen control - This lets you change and update
  the contents of the viewscreen you are controlling. The actual viewscreen is
  controlled on the left; the preview viewscreen is controlled on the right.

**More coming soon**
