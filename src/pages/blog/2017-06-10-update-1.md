* Added a coolant tank system and card
* Added coolant support for engines and phasers
* Revamped the sensors to make it more performant and consistent. Finished a minimal feature set.
* Added unit tests for half of the system classes
* Started on a frame for lower resolution screens.

That's it for this week. Be sure to file any feature requests on the [Github repo](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/issues).
