- Add the ability to black out certain segments of the sensors grid.
- Add officer's log card and widget. No core yet.
- Added the signal jammer card.
- Updated the client download links to point to a remote server so Thorium itself doesn't have to be so bloated.

Don't forget, as a donor you get access to the latest builds of Thorium. [Donate Today!](/en/donate). If you have already donated, you can access the builds on the [releases page](/en/releases).

That's it for this week. Be sure to file any feature requests on the [Github repo](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/issues) and see the current [roadmap](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/projects/2).
