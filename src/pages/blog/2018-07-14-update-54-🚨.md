### Announcement
This is the first regular minor update, going from 0.2.x to 0.3.x. I'm doing this because this update has a major change which could break your Thorium configuration. Make sure you keep a copy of the old version of your Thorium executable and your Thorium data directory, stored at `/Users/**your username/Documents/thorium` on a Mac or `C:\Users\**your username\Documents\thorium` on a Windows computer.

## Version 0.3.0
- **Major Upgrade**: The asset system is now based entirely on the file system of the assets folder in the Thorium data directory. That means you can add the files directly in the file system without having to use the Thorium configuration page.

- Worked on a large number of minor fixes. See [this issue](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/issues/991) for details. Highlights are below.

- Added the Dilithium Stress Card. The core for this card is on the `ReactorControlCore` 
- Made it possible to launch probes from the Torpedo system. This option is checked when configuring the Probes system
- Added an 'F&S' (Flash and Send) button for processed data which flashes the screen and auto-navigates to the processed data screen when you send Sensors processed data.
- Thrusters can now be preset with speeds in the Thrusters system config screen.
- Added actions for 'Movie', which overlays a movie from the '/Movie' directory in the assets folder, and 'Change Card' which forces the station to go to a specific card.
- Borders and planets now take labels, and borders can be defined with a width
- Added sensor pings, which ping from the location dropped, and then disappear. 
- Improvements to heat, coolant, and battery usage.

- Issues resolved in this update:
