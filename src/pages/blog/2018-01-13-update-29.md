- Completed the Exocomp card. Linked it with damaged systems.
- Added an on-screen keyboard widget.
- Improvements to make the controls look and work better at 1080p
- Fixed broken assets on the build
- Fixed issues with Windows not uploading assets properly
- Added the library database card. 

As a side note, I released an open-source package called [React DMX](https://github.com/alexanderson1993/react-dmx) which can be used to control DMX lighting with React components.

Don't forget, as a donor you get access to the latest builds of Thorium. [Donate Today!](/en/donate). If you have already donated, you can access the builds on the [releases page](/en/releases).

That's it for this week. Be sure to file any feature requests on the [Github repo](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/issues) and see the current [roadmap](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/projects/2).
