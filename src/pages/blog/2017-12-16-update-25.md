- Gave this site a facelift. It has all of the same content, but also includes documentation links. Currently the links are all stubs for more content to come.
- Missions are now bundled with assets and anything else which they might need to be imported. This makes them completely portable and transferrable between different installations of Thorium with ease.
- A buch of bug fixes:
  - Fixed sensors nudge buttons
  - Fixed issues with Navigation core breaking
  - Fixed the viewscreen breaking when changing clients
  - Removed the cursor from the viewscreen
  - Enabled manually typing in course for navigation
  - Fixed the sensors speed button
  - Made it so the thrusters dragging buttons snapped to axes to make it easier to manipulate single thrusters
  - Added a damage report widget for the damage control screen
  - Transporter targeting is now more consistent
  - Teams can no longer be sent out without team members
  - Added power bars to the engine control screen so you can see what speeds are available with the power given.
