## Version 0.2.9

* It is now possible to get survey results in a CSV once the survey is complete.
  You'll have to process the data on your own. You can also see the number of
  responses you've received.

* Added room roles, making it possible to assign a room to be the source for
  equipment for various systems, eg. Probes, Torpedos, and armory equipment.

* Added armory cards for damage teams, security teams, and medical teams.

* Added a medical teams card. This card is lacking in training, but it will be
  added soon.

* Added a fix for login logos not showing up correctly and making the rest of
  the screen appear funky.

* Improved how the simulator assets config works.

* The base assets package automatically downloads when you start Thorium for the
  first time.

* Fixes to core layouts.

* Issues resolved in this update:
