- Fixed additional bugs discovered during a test flight.
- Added React error boundaries. This makes it so if there is a critial error that breaks the entire screen, it will cause the screen to go to an in-universe error screen, tailored to the layout.
- Systems now have reference to rooms on the ship
- Damage reports can now be auto-generated. These damage reports can be generic, or specific damage steps can be assigned to the system.
- Fixed bugs in the Advanced Navigation; added a core.
