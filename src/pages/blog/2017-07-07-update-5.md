* Major refactor of the control room system
    - Removed the top tab-bar for the 'control room' screen.
    - Refactored and completed the simulator config for pre-defining template simulators with stations, cards, systems, decks, etc.
    - Refactored the flight initiation process to simplify it.
    - Simplified the initial landing page.
* Implemented 'Sets', or pre-defined simulator client configurations.
    - This makes it possible to automatically start up all of the stations on the screens which they are supposed to be on for the flight.
* Implemented an 'Alert Condition' card
* Added icons for all currently developed cards.
