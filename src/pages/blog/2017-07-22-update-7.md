As a reminder, I'm starting a WebDev Guild. There is an advancement guide available on the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/alexanderson1993/webdev-guild).

That's it for this week. Be sure to file any feature requests on the [Github repo](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/issues). You can also download the latest [alpha](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/releases) and see the current [roadmap](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/projects/2).
