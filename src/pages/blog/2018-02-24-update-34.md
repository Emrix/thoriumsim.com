## Version 0.2.7

* A significant number of bug fixes, enumerated
  [here](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+closed%3A%3E%3D2018-02-10)
* Fixed a number of other bugs enumerated
  [here](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/issues/531)
* Core feed items now show as notifications, and turn into actionable components
  when you click on them.
* There is now training mode on the login screen, which explains how to navigate
  the layout, access card training, and explains the widgets.
* Adds training for the widgets. Only Remote Access has training now, but more
  will be added in the future.
* Began working on survey forms.
* Added Hypercards as a feature. You can assign all or individual stations a
  hypercard which makes that screen override what is on the station.
* Added mission objectives.
* Fixed a bug with running multiple servers on the same network.
* Added more credits.
* Added a new core, called Next. This core is intended to be the default core.

This has been a fairly calm few weeks with regard to new features. It's been
busy for me personally, but I have also devoted a good amount of time to a new
project. More information about this project will be coming soon.
