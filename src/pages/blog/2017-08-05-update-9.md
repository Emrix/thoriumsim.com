This week has been spent on a number of side project, including an exciting announcement (stay tuned!) so there weren't as much progress on Thorium. Regardless, there are a few updates:

* Bug fixes for:
  * Shields
  * Navigation
  * Core
  * Thrusters
  * Damage Teams
  * Comm
  * Power Distribution
  * Probe Control
  * Sensors
  * Transporters
  * Internal Scanning
* Add Flow Typing for static type checking
* Add local fonts so Thorium can run 100% offline

That's it for this week. Be sure to file any feature requests on the [Github repo](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/issues). You can also download the latest [alpha](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/releases) and see the current [roadmap](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/projects/2).
