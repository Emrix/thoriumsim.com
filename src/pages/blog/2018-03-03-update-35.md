## Version 0.2.8

* Added hotkey support in cores. By holding down a function key (F1, F2, etc.),
  you can pop up any possible core. This is handy to get heads-up information,
  or to make a small adjustment to something when necessary. More info
  [here](/docs/core_layouts.html#function-key-popups).
* Continued working on the survey forms. It is now possible to make survey forms
  and deliver them. However, there isn't anything available to process the
  surveyform data.
* Fixed a few bugs, enumerated
  [here](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+closed%3A2018-02-24..2018-03-03).
