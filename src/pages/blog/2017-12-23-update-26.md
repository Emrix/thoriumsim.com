- Created a frame matching the Odyssey simulator
- Added a complete configuration for the Odyssey
- Revamped the crew core and configuration. While it is still possible to import and edit crew members, there are now buttons to create randomly generated crew members.
- Made it possible to have Navigation be thruster-based instead of coordinate based
- Added 'Sensor history', which makes it possible to make multiple sensor scans simultaneously and see the results of past scans.
- Many bug fixes
  - Power distribution works more consistently and includes power available and power draw
  - Shield frequency changing is faster
  - Made it possible to remove sets and tactical maps
  - Made it possible to activate stealth from core
  - Keypad typing is more consistent
