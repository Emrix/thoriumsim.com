# Announcement

We'll be doing a Thorium Developer workshop on August 25th on BYU campus in Provo. This workshop will be focused on getting developers up to speed on how Thorium works, how to extend it, and how to make new screens. More details will come. If you want to help with development or learn about how Thorium was designed behind the scenes, come on by! Learn more here: [https://thoriumsim.com/workshop](https://thoriumsim.com/workshop)

Want to contribute? [Check out the contributing guide](https://github.com/Thorium-Sim/thorium/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). 

## Version 0.4.3

* Added progress bars to Thorium update and first-load asset downloads.
* Improved the layout of several cards at smaller screen sizes.
* Refactored several parts of the front-end and back-end to be easier for developers to approach.
* Improved importing and exporting for crews and decks and rooms.
* Added the ability to rename sets.
* Added the ability to adjust the battery charge/depletion rate in the simulator config
* Added the ability to pre-configure torpedos.
* Improved the staging area for sensors, giving the flight director more space to prepare sensors contacts. 
* Added a time to battery depletion counter to the Reactor core.
* Added the ability to selectively choose which core-feed items and notifications appear in a specific browser. These settings are not transferrable and only apply to that specific browser. This is good for differentiating notifications between Core and AuxCore.
* Made it easier to know which cards have been assigned to a station set when configuring station sets.
* Bundled a template 'Voyager' simulator to make it easier for first-timers to get up and running with Thorium.
* Added a secret feature to the Stealth Field üòè
* Added the Phoenix Frame
